It now treats 0 as 0, and will return an empty slice.  \n+To request unbounded results, use -1 (or some other negative value).\n+The new Replace functions in bytes and strings share this behavior.\n+This may require you change your existing code.\n+\n+The gob package now allows the transmission of non-struct values at the\n+top-level. As a result, the rpc and netchan packages have fewer restrictions\n+on the types they can handle.  For example, netchan can now share a chan int.\n+\n+The release also includes a Code Walk: \"Share Memory By Communicating\".\n+It describes an idiomatic Go program that uses goroutines and channels:\n+\thttp://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/\n+\n+There is now a Projects page on the Go Dashboard that lists Go programs, \n+tools, and libraries:\n+\thttp://godashboard.appspot.com/project\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* 6a, 6l: bug fixes.\n+* bytes, strings: add Replace.\n+* cgo: use slash-free relative paths for .so references.\n+* cmath: correct IsNaN for argument cmplx(Inf, NaN) (thanks Charles L. Dorian).\n+* codereview: allow multiple email addresses in CONTRIBUTORS.\n+* doc/codewalk: add Share Memory By Communicating.\n+* exp/draw/x11: implement the mapping from keycodes to keysyms.\n+* fmt: Printf: fix bug in handling of %#v, allow other verbs for slices\n+        Scan: fix handling of EOFs.\n+* gc: bug fixes and optimizations.\n+* gob: add DecodeValue and EncodeValue,\n+        add support for complex numbers.\n+* goinstall: support for Bazaar+Launchpad (thanks Gustavo Niemeyer).\n+* io/ioutil: add TempFile for Windows (thanks Peter Mundy).\n+* ld: add -u flag to check safe bits; discard old -u, -x flags.\n+* math: amd64 versions of Exp and Fabs (thanks Charles L. Dorian).\n+* misc/vim: always override filetype detection for .go files.\n+* net: add support for DNS SRV requests (thanks Kirklin McDonald),\n+        initial attempt to implement Windows version (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* netchan: allow chan of basic types now that gob can handle such,\n+        eliminate the need for a pointer value in Import and Export.\n+* os/signal: only catch all signals if os/signal package imported.\n+* regexp: bug fix: need to track whether match begins with fixed prefix.\n+* rpc: allow non-struct args and reply (they must still be pointers).\n+* runtime: bug fixes and reorganization.\n+* strconv: fix bugs in floating-point and base 2 conversions\n+* syscall: add syscall_bsd.go to zsycall_freebsd_386.go (thanks Peter Mundy),\n+        add socketpair (thanks Ivan Krasin).\n+* time: implement time zones for Windows (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* x509: support non-self-signed certs. \n+</pre>\n+\n <h3 id=\"2010-06-21\">2010-06-21</h3>\n \n <pre>"}]}

If you use the log or iterable packages, you need to make\n+changes to your code.\n+\n+The log package has changed.  Loggers now have only one output, and output to\n+standard error by default.  The names have also changed, although the old names\n+are still supported.  They will be deleted in the next release, though, so it\n+would be good to update now if you can.  For most purposes all you need to do\n+is make these substitutions:\n+        log.Stderr -> log.Println or log.Print\n+        log.Stderrf -> log.Printf\n+        log.Crash -> log.Panicln or log.Panic\n+        log.Crashf -> log.Panicf\n+        log.Exit -> log.Exitln or log.Exit\n+        log.Exitf -> log.Exitf (no change)\n+Calls to log.New() must drop the second argument.\n+Also, custom loggers with exit or panic properties will need to be reworked.\n+For full details, see the change description:\n+        http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=d8a3c7563d\n+\n+The language change is that uses of pointers to interface values no longer\n+automatically dereference the pointer.  A pointer to an interface value is more\n+often a beginnerâ€™s bug than correct code.\n+\n+The package exp/iterable has been removed. It was an interesting experiment,\n+but it encourages writing inefficient code and has outlived its utility.\n+\n+The new tools:\n+* gotry: an exercise in reflection and an unusual tool. Run 'gotry' for details.\n+* goplay: a stand-alone version of the Go Playground. See misc/goplay.\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* 6l: Mach-O fixes, and fix to work with OS X nm/otool (thanks Jim McGrath).\n+* [568]a: correct line numbers for statements.\n+* arm: code generation and runtime fixes\n+* big: fix panic and round correctly in Rat.FloatString (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* build: Make.cmd: remove $(OFILES) (thanks Eric Clark),\n+        Make.pkg: remove .so before installing new one,\n+        add GOHOSTOS and GOHOSTARCH environment variables.\n+* crypto/tls: better error messages for certificate issues,\n+        make SetReadTimeout work.\n+* doc: add Sydney University video to docs page.\n+* exp/draw/x11: support X11 vendors other than \"The X.Org Foundation\".\n+* expvar: add (*Int).Set (thanks Sam Thorogood).\n+* fmt: add Errorf helper function,\n+        allow %d on []byte.\n+* gc: O(1) string comparison when lengths differ,\n+        various bug fixes.\n+* http: return the correct error if a header line is too long.\n+* image: add image.Tiled type, the Go equivalent of Plan 9's repl bit.\n+* ld: be less picky about bad line number info.\n+* misc/cgo/life: fix for new slice rules (thanks Graham Miller).\n+* net: allow _ in DNS names.\n+* netchan: export before import when testing, and\n+        zero out request to ensure correct gob decoding. (thanks Roger Peppe).\n+* os: make tests work on windows (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* runtime: bug fix: serialize mcache allocation,\n+        correct iteration of large map values,\n+        faster strequal, memequal (thanks Graham Miller),\n+        fix argument dump in traceback,\n+        fix tiny build.\n+* smtp: new package (thanks Evan Shaw).\n+* syscall: add sockaddr_ll support for linux/386, linux/amd64 (thanks Mikio Hara),\n+        add ucred structure for SCM_CREDENTIALS over UNIX sockets. (thanks Albert Strasheim).\n+* syscall: implement WaitStatus and Wait4() for windows (thanks Wei Guangjing).\n+* time: add After.\n+* websocket: enable tests on windows (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+</pre>\n+\n <h3 id=\"2010-09-29\">2010-09-29</h3>\n \n <pre>"}]}

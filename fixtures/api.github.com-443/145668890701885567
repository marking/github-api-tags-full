Accessing a non-existent key in a map is no longer a run-time error.  \n+It now evaluates to the zero value for that type.  For example:\n+        x := myMap[i]   is now equivalent to:   x, _ := myMap[i]\n+\n+2. It is now legal to take the address of a function's return value.  \n+The return values are copied back to the caller only after deferred\n+functions have run.\n+\n+3. The functions panic and recover, intended for reporting and recovering from\n+failure, have been added to the spec:\n+\thttp://golang.org/doc/go_spec.html#Handling_panics \n+In a related change, panicln is gone, and panic is now a single-argument\n+function.  Panic and recover are recognized by the gc compilers but the new\n+behavior is not yet implemented.\n+\n+The ARM build is broken in this release; ARM users should stay at release.2010-03-22.\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* bytes, strings: add IndexAny.\n+* cc/ld: Add support for #pragma dynexport,\n+        Rename dynld to dynimport throughout. Cgo users will need to rerun cgo.\n+* expvar: default publishings for cmdline, memstats\n+* flag: add user-defined flag types.\n+* gc: usual bug fixes\n+* go/ast: generalized ast filtering.\n+* go/printer: avoid reflect in print.\n+* godefs: fix handling of negative constants.\n+* godoc: export pprof debug information, exported variables,\n+        support for filtering of command-line output in -src mode,\n+        use http GET for remote search instead of rpc.\n+* gofmt: don't convert multi-line functions into one-liners,\n+        preserve newlines in multiline selector expressions (thanks Risto Jaakko Saarelma).\n+* goinstall: include command name in error reporting (thanks Andrey Mirtchovski)\n+* http: add HandleFunc as shortcut to Handle(path, HandlerFunc(func))\n+* make: use actual dependency for install\n+* math: add J1, Y1, Jn, Yn, J0, Y0 (Bessel functions) (thanks Charles L. Dorian)\n+* prof: add pprof from google-perftools\n+* regexp: don't return non-nil *Regexp if there is an error.\n+* runtime: add Callers,\n+        add malloc sampling, pprof interface,\n+        add memory profiling, more statistics to runtime.MemStats,\n+        implement missing destroylock() (thanks Alex Brainman),\n+        more malloc statistics,\n+        run all finalizers in a single goroutine,\n+        Goexit runs deferred calls.\n+* strconv: add Atob and Btoa,\n+        Unquote could wrongly return a nil error on error (thanks Roger Peppe).\n+* syscall: add IPV6 constants,\n+        add syscall_bsd.go for Darwin and other *BSDs (thanks Giles Lean),\n+        implement SetsockoptString (thanks Christopher Wedgwood).\n+* websocket: implement new protocol (thanks Fumitoshi Ukai).\n+* xgb: fix request length and request size (thanks Firmansyah Adiputra).\n+* xml: add CopyToken (thanks Kyle Consalus),\n+        add line numbers to syntax errors (thanks Kyle Consalus),\n+        use io.ReadByter in place of local readByter (thanks Raif S. Naffah). \n+</pre>\n+\n <h3 id=\"2010-03-22\">2010-03-22</h3>\n \n <pre>"}]}

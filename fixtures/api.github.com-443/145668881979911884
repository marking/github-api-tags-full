If you use crypto/block, you’ll need\n+to switch to crypto/cipher once it is complete.\n+\n+Package smtp’s StartTLS now takes a *tls.Config argument.\n+\n+Package reflect’s ArrayCopy has been renamed to Copy.  There are new functions\n+Append and AppendSlice.\n+\n+The print/println bootstrapping functions now write to standard error.\n+To write to standard output, use fmt.Print[ln].\n+\n+A new tool, govet, has been added to the Go distribution. Govet is a static\n+checker for Go programs. At the moment, and for the forseeable future,\n+it only checks arguments to print calls.\n+\n+The cgo tool for writing Go bindings for C code has changed so that it no\n+longer uses stub .so files (like cgo_stdio.so).  Cgo-based packages using the\n+standard Makefiles should build without any changes.  Any alternate build\n+mechanisms will need to be updated.\n+\n+The C and Go compilers (6g, 6c, 8g, 8c, 5g, 5c) now align structs according to\n+the maximum alignment of the fields they contain; previously they aligned\n+structs to word boundaries.  This may break non-cgo-based code that attempts to\n+mix C and Go.\n+\n+NaCl support has been removed. The recent linker changes broke NaCl support\n+a month ago, and there are no known users of it.\n+If necessary, the NaCl code can be recovered from the repository history.\n+\n+* 5g/8g, 8l, ld, prof: fix output of 32-bit values (thanks Eoghan Sherry).\n+* [68]l and runtime: GDB support for interfaces and goroutines.\n+* 6l, 8l: support for linking ELF and Mach-O .o files.\n+* all: simplify two-variable ranges with unused second variable (thanks Ryan Hitchman).\n+* arm: updated soft float support.\n+* codereview: keep quiet when not in use (thanks Eoghan Sherry).\n+* compress/flate: implement Flush, equivalent to zlib's Z_SYNC_FLUSH.\n+* crypto/tls: use rand.Reader in cert generation example (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* dashboard: fix project tag filter.\n+* debug/elf, debug/macho: add ImportedLibraries, ImportedSymbols.\n+* doc/go_mem: goroutine exit is not special.\n+* event.go: another print glitch from gocheck.\n+* gc: bug fixes,\n+        syntax error for incomplete chan type (thanks Ryan Hitchman).\n+* go/ast: fix ast.Walk.\n+* gob: document the byte count used in the encoding of values,\n+        fix bug sending zero-length top-level slices and maps,\n+        Register should use the original type, not the indirected one.\n+* godashboard: support submitting projects with non-ascii names (thanks Ryan Hitchman)\n+* godefs: guard against structs with pad fields\n+* godoc: added textual search, to enable use -fulltext flag.\n+* gofmt: simplify \"x, _ = range y\" to \"x = range y\".\n+* gopack: allow ELF/Mach-O objects in .a files without clearing allobj.\n+* go/token,scanner: fix comments so godoc aligns properly.\n+* govet: on error continue to the next file (thanks Christopher Wedgwood).\n+* html: improved parsing.\n+* http: ServeFile handles Range header for partial requests.\n+* json: check for invalid UTF-8.\n+* ld: allow .o files with no symbols,\n+        reading of ELF object files,\n+        reading of Mach-O object files.\n+* math: change float64 bias constant from 1022 to 1023 (thanks Eoghan Sherry),\n+        rename the MinFloat constant to SmallestNonzeroFloat.\n+* nm: silently ignore .o files in .a files.\n+* os: fix test of RemoveAll.\n+* os/inotify: new package (thanks Balazs Lecz).\n+* os: make MkdirAll work with symlinks (thanks Ryan Hitchman).\n+* regexp: simplify code for brackets, speed up by about 30%.\n+* runtime/linux/386: set FPU to 64-bit precision.\n+* runtime: remove paranoid mapping at 0.\n+* suffixarray: add Bytes function.\n+* syscall: add network interface constants for linux/386, linux/amd64 (thanks Mikio Hara).\n+* syscall/windows: restrict access rights param of OpenProcess(),\n+        remove \\r and \\n from error messages (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* test/bench: fixes to timing.sh (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* time: fix bug in Ticker: shutdown using channel rather than memory.\n+* token/position: provide FileSet.File, provide files iterator.\n+* xml: disallow invalid Unicode code points (thanks Nigel Kerr).\n+</pre>\n+\n <h3 id=\"2010-12-08\">2010-12-08</h3>\n \n <pre>"}]}

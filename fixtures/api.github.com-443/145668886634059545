You may need to change your\n+code if you use the once, regexp, image, or exp/draw packages.\n+\n+The type Once has been added to the sync package. The new sync.Once will\n+supersede the functionality provided by the once package. We intend to remove\n+the once package after this release. See:\n+    http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Once\n+All instances of once in the standard library have been replaced with\n+sync.Once. Reviewing these changes may help you modify your existing code. \n+The relevant changeset:\n+    http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=fa2c43595119\n+\n+A new set of methods has been added to the regular expression package, regexp.\n+These provide a uniformly named approach to discovering the matches of an\n+expression within a piece of text; see the package documentation for details: \n+    http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/\n+These new methods will, in a later release, replace the old methods for\n+matching substrings.  The following methods are deprecated:\n+    Execute (use Find)\n+    ExecuteString (use FindString)\n+    MatchStrings(use FindStringSubmatch)\n+    MatchSlices (use FindSubmatch)\n+    AllMatches (use FindAll; note that n<0 means 'all matches'; was n<=0)\n+    AllMatchesString (use FindAllString; note that n<0 means 'all matches'; was n<=0)\n+(Plus there are ten new methods you didn't know you wanted.) \n+Please update your code to use the new routines before the next release.\n+\n+An image.Image now has a Bounds rectangle, where previously it ranged \n+from (0, 0) to (Width, Height). Loops that previously looked like:\n+    for y := 0; y < img.Height(); y++ {\n+        for x := 0; x < img.Width(); x++ {\n+            // Do something with img.At(x, y)\n+        }\n+    }\n+should instead be:\n+    b := img.Bounds()\n+    for y := b.Min.Y; y < b.Max.Y; y++ {\n+        for x := b.Min.X; x < b.Max.X; x++ {\n+            // Do something with img.At(x, y)\n+        }\n+    }\n+The Point and Rectangle types have also moved from exp/draw to image.\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* arm: bugfixes and syscall (thanks Kai Backman).\n+* asn1: fix incorrect encoding of signed integers (thanks Nicholas Waples).\n+* big: fixes to bitwise functions (thanks Evan Shaw).\n+* bytes: add IndexRune, FieldsFunc and To*Special (thanks Christian Himpel).\n+* encoding/binary: add complex (thanks Roger Peppe).\n+* exp/iterable: add UintArray (thanks Anschel Schaffer-Cohen).\n+* godoc: report Status 404 if a pkg or file is not found.\n+* gofmt: better reporting for unexpected semicolon errors.\n+* html: new package, an HTML tokenizer.\n+* image: change image representation from slice-of-slices to linear buffer,\n+        introduce Decode and RegisterFormat,\n+        introduce Transparent and Opaque,\n+        replace Width and Height by Bounds, add the Point and Rect types.\n+* libbio: fix Bprint to address 6g issues with large data structures.\n+* math: fix amd64 Hypot (thanks Charles L. Dorian).\n+* net/textproto: new package, with example net/dict.\n+* os: fix ForkExec() handling of envv == nil (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* png: grayscale support (thanks Mathieu Lonjaret).\n+* regexp: document that backslashes are the escape character.\n+* rpc: catch errors from ReadResponseBody.\n+* runtime: memory free fix (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* template: add ParseFile method to template.Template.\n+* test/peano: use directly recursive type def.\n+</pre>\n+\n <h3 id=\"2010-08-04\">2010-08-04</h3>\n \n <pre>"}]}

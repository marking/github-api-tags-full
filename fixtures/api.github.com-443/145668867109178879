Please read these notes carefully, as there are many\n+changes and your code will likely be affected.\n+\n+The syntax for map deletion has been changed. Code that looks like:\n+\tm[x] = 0, false\n+should be written as:\n+\tdelete(m, x)\n+The compiler still accepts m[x] = 0, false for now; even so, you can use gofix\n+to rewrite such assignments into delete(m, x).\n+\n+The Go compiler will reject a return statement without arguments when any of\n+the result variables has been shadowed. Code rejected as a result of this\n+change is likely to be buggy.\n+\n+Receive-only channels (<-chan T) cannot be closed.\n+The compiler will diagnose such attempts.\n+\n+The first element of a map iteration is chosen at random. Code that depends on\n+iteration order will need to be updated.\n+\n+Goroutines may be run during program initialization.\n+\n+A string may be appended to a byte slice. This code is now legal:\n+\tvar b []byte\n+\tvar s string\n+\tb = append(b, s...)\n+\n+The gotry command and its associated try package have been deleted.\n+It was a fun experiment that - in the end - didn't carry its weight.\n+\n+The gotype tool has been moved to exp/gotype and its associated go/types\n+package has been moved to exp/types. The deprecated go/typechecker package has\n+been deleted.\n+\n+The enbflint tool has been moved to pkg/exp/ebnflint and its associated ebnf\n+package has been moved to pkg/exp/ebnf.\n+\n+The netchan package has been moved to old/netchan.\n+\n+The http/spdy package has been moved to exp/spdy.\n+\n+The exp/datafmt package has been deleted.\n+\n+The container/vector package has been deleted. Slices are better:\n+\thttp://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/SliceTricks\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* 5l/6l/8l: correct ELFRESERVE diagnostic (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* 6l/8l: support OS X code signing (thanks Mikkel Krautz).\n+* asn1: accept UTF8 strings as ASN.1 ANY values.\n+* big: handle aliasing correctly for Rat.SetFrac.\n+* build: add missing nuke target (thanks Anthony Martin),\n+\tcatch future accidental dependencies to exp or old packages,\n+\tmore robustly detect gold 2.20 (thanks Christopher Wedgwood),\n+\tpass $GCFLAGS to compiler,\n+\tstop on failed deps.bash.\n+* crypto/tls: add 3DES ciphersuites,\n+\tadd server side SNI support,\n+\tfetch root CA from Windows store (thanks Mikkel Krautz),\n+\tfetch root certificates using Mac OS API (thanks Mikkel Krautz),\n+\tfix broken looping code in windows root CA fetcher (thanks Mikkel Krautz),\n+\tmore Unix root certificate locations.\n+* crypto/x509: add code for dealing with PKIX public keys,\n+\tkeep the raw Subject and Issuer.\n+* csv: fix overly aggressive TrimLeadingSpace.\n+* exp/ssh: general cleanups for client support (thanks Dave Cheney).\n+* exp/template/html: fix bug in cssEscaper.\n+* exp/terminal: split terminal handling from exp/ssh.\n+* exp/winfsnotify: filesystem watcher for Windows (thanks Hector Chu).\n+* fmt: fix test relying on map iteration order.\n+* gc: changes to export format in preparation for inlining,\n+\tpass FlagNoPointers to runtime.new,\n+\tpreserve uint8 and byte distinction in errors and import data,\n+\tstricter multiple assignment + test,\n+\ttreat uintptr as potentially containing a pointer.\n+* go/scanner: remove AllowIllegalChars mode.\n+* go/token: document deserialization property.\n+* gob: avoid one copy for every message written.\n+* godefs: add enum/const testdata (thanks Dave Cheney).\n+* godoc: generate package toc in template, not in JavaScript,\n+\tshow \"unexported\" declarations when executing \"godoc builtin\",\n+\tshow correct source name with -path.\n+* gofix: make fix order explicit, add mapdelete.\n+* gofmt: fix //line handling,\n+\tdisallow rewrites for incomplete programs.\n+* gotest: avoid conflicts with the name of the tested package (thanks Esko Luontola),\n+\ttest example code.\n+* goyacc: clean up after units (thanks Anthony Martin),\n+\tmake more gofmt-compliant.\n+* html: add a Render function, various bug fixes and improvements,\n+\tparser improvements (thanks Andrew Balholm).\n+* http: DoS protection: cap non-Handler Request.Body reads,\n+\tRoundTrippers shouldn't mutate Request,\n+\tavoid panic caused by nil URL (thanks Anthony Martin),\n+\tfix read timeouts and closing,\n+\tremove Request.RawURL.\n+* image/tiff: implement PackBits decoding (thanks Benny Siegert).\n+* ld: fix \"cannot create 8.out.exe\" (thanks Jaroslavas Počepko).\n+* misc/emacs: add a \"godoc\" command, like M-x man (thanks Evan Martin).\n+* misc/swig: delete binaries (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* misc/windows: automated toolchain packager (thanks Joe Poirier).\n+* net/windows: implement ip protocol name to number resolver (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* net: add File method to IPConn (thanks Mikio Hara),\n+\tallow LookupSRV on non-standard DNS names,\n+\tfix \"unexpected socket family\" error from WriteToUDP (thanks Albert Strasheim),\n+\tfix socket leak in case of Dial failure (thanks Chris Farmiloe),\n+\tremove duplicate error information in Dial (thanks Andrey Mirtchovski),\n+\treturn error from CloseRead and CloseWrite (thanks Albert Strasheim),\n+\tskip ICMP test on Windows too unless uid 0.\n+* reflect: disallow Interface method on Value obtained via unexported name,\n+\tmake unsafe use of SliceHeader gc-friendly.\n+* rpc: don't panic on write error.\n+* runtime: faster strings,\n+\tfix crash if user sets MemProfileRate=0,\n+\tfix crash when returning from syscall during gc (thanks Hector Chu),\n+\tfix memory leak in parallel garbage collector.\n+* scanner: invalidate scanner.Position when no token is present.\n+* spec: define order of multiple assignment.\n+* syscall/windows: dll function load and calling changes (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* syscall: add #ifdefs to fix the manual corrections in ztypes_linux_arm.go (thanks Dave Cheney),\n+\tadjust Mount to accomodate stricter FS implementations.\n+* testing: fix time reported for failing tests.\n+* utf8: add Valid and ValidString.\n+* websocket: tweak hybi ReadHandshake to support Firefox (thanks Luca Greco).\n+* xml: match Marshal's XMLName behavior in Unmarshal (thanks Chris Farmiloe).\n+</pre>\n+\n <h2 id=\"2011-10-06\">2011-10-06</h2>\n \n <pre>"}]}

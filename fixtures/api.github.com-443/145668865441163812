For HTML templates, simply use the\n+html/template package as you would the template package.\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* all: rename os.EOF to io.EOF in non-code contexts (thanks Vincent Vanackere),\n+\tsort imports with gofix.\n+* archive/zip: close file opened with OpenReader (thanks Dmitry Chestnykh).\n+* bufio: return nil line from ReadLine on error, as documented.\n+* builtin: document basic types and the built-in error type.\n+* bytes: add Contains function.\n+* exp/sql: finish implementation of transactions, flesh out types, docs.\n+* exp/ssh: improved client authentication support (thanks Dave Cheney).\n+* gc: better error message for range over non-receive channel,\n+\tbug fixes and clean-ups,\n+\tdetect type switch variable not used cases,\n+\tfix escaping of package paths in symbol names,\n+\thelpful error message on method call on pointer to pointer,\n+\tportably read archive headers (thanks Ron Minnich).\n+* gob: fix bug when registering the same type multiple times.\n+* gofix: avoid panic on body-less functions in netudpgroup,\n+\tmake fix order implicit by date.\n+* gofmt, gofix: sort imports.\n+* goinstall: support launchpad.net/~user branches (thanks Jani Monoses).\n+* gopack: do not look for Go metadata in non-Go objects.\n+* gotest: don't run examples that have no expected output.\n+* html: the parser bug fixing campaign continues (thanks Andrew Balholm).\n+* http: fix whitespace handling in sniffer,\n+\tonly recognize application/x-www-form-urlencoded in ParseForm,\n+\tsupport Trailers in ReadRequest.\n+* lib9: add ctime.\n+* math: faster Gamma (thanks Charles L.

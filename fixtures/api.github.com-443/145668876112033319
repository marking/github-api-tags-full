Code that uses these packages will need changes. Most of these\n+changes can be made automatically with gofix.\n+\n+The strings package's Split function has itself been split into Split and\n+SplitN. SplitN is the same as the old Split. The new Split is equivalent to\n+SplitN with a final argument of -1.\n+\n+The http package has a new FileSystem interface that provides access to files.\n+The FileServer helper now takes a FileSystem argument instead of an explicit\n+file system root. By implementing your own FileSystem you can use the\n+FileServer to serve arbitrary data.\n+\n+The reflect package supports a new struct tag scheme that enables sharing of\n+struct tags between multiple packages.\n+In this scheme, the tags must be of the form:\n+        key:\"value\" key2:\"value2\"\n+reflect.StructField's Tag field now has type StructTag (a string type), which\n+has method Get(key string) string that returns the associated value.\n+Clients of json and xml will need to be updated. Code that says\n+        type T struct {\n+                X int \"name\"\n+        }\n+should become\n+        type T struct {\n+                X int `json:\"name\"`  // or `xml:\"name\"`\n+        }\n+Use govet to identify struct tags that need to be changed to use the new syntax.\n+\n+Other changes:\n+* 5l, 6l, 8l: drop use of ed during build.\n+* asn1: support T61 and UTF8 string.\n+* bufio: do not cache Read errors (thanks Graham Miller).\n+* build: make version.bash aware of branches.\n+* cgi: don't depend on CGI.pm for tests.\n+* codereview: make --ignore_hgpatch_failure work again,\n+\trestrict sync to default branch.\n+* crypto/openpgp: add ability to reserialize keys,\n+\tbug fix (thanks Gideon Jan-Wessel Redelinghuys).\n+* crypto/tls: fix generate_cert.go.\n+* crypto/x509: prevent chain cycles in Verify.\n+* csv: new package.\n+* doc: remove ed from apt-get package list.\n+* docs: fold the prog.sh scripting from makehtml into htmlgen itself.\n+* ebnflint: better handling of stdin.\n+* exp/regexp/syntax: new experimental RE2-based regexp implementation.\n+* exp/template: a new experimental templating package.\n+* fmt: add SkipSpace to fmt's ScanState interface.\n+* fmt: rename errno and error to err for doc consistency.\n+* gc: avoid package name ambiguity in error messages,\n+\tfix package quoting logic,\n+\tfixes for Plan 9 (thanks Lucio De Re).\n+* go/build: evaluate symlinks before comparing path to GOPATH.\n+* gob: use exported fields in structs in the package documentation.\n+* godoc: ignore directories that begin with '.',\n+\tsearch GOPATH for documentation.\n+* gofix: os/signal, path/filepath, and sort fixes (thanks Robert Hencke),\n+* goinstall: add support for generic hosts (thanks Julian Phillips),\n+\tonly report successfully-installed packages to the dashboard,\n+\ttry to access via https (thanks Yasuhiro Matsumoto).\n+* gotest: add -test.benchtime and -test.cpu flags.\n+* html: fixes and improvements (thanks Yasuhiro Matsumoto).\n+* http/cgi: add Handler.Dir to specify working directory (thanks Yasuhiro Matsumoto).\n+* http: add StripPrefix handler wrapper,\n+\tassume ContentLength 0 on GET requests,\n+\tbetter handling of 0-length Request.Body,\n+\tdo TLS handshake explicitly before copying TLS state,\n+\tdocument that ServerConn and ClientConn are low-level,\n+\tmake NewChunkedReader public (thanks Andrew Balholm),\n+\trespect Handlers setting Connection: close in their response.\n+* image: more tests, Paletted.Opaque optimization.\n+* io.WriteString: if the object has a WriteString method, use it (thanks Evan Shaw).\n+* ld: elide the Go symbol table when using -s (thanks Anthony Martin).\n+* ld: fix ELF strip by removing overlap of sections (thanks Gustavo Niemeyer).\n+* mime/multipart: parse LF-delimited messages, not just CRLF.\n+* mime: permit lower-case media type parameters (thanks Pascal S. de Kloe).\n+* misc/dashboard: new features and improvements (not yet deployed).\n+* misc/emacs: update list of builtins (thanks Quan Yong Zhai).\n+* misc/vim: allow only utf-8 for file encoding (thanks Yasuhiro Matsumoto).\n+* os: fix documentation for FileInfo.Name,\n+\tsimplify WriteString,\n+\tuse a different symbol from syscall in mkunixsignals.sh.\n+* path/filepath: enable TestWalk to run on windows (thanks Alex Brainman).\n+* reflect: add MethodByName,\n+\tallow Len on String values.\n+* regexp: document that Regexp is thread-safe.\n+* runtime/cgo: check for errors from pthread_create (thanks Albert Strasheim).\n+* runtime: add Semacquire/Semrelease benchmarks,\n+\timproved Semacquire/Semrelease implementation,\n+\twindows/amd64 port (thanks Wei Guangjing).\n+* sync: add fast path to Once,\n+\timprove Mutex to allow successive acquisitions,\n+\tnew and improved benchmarks.\n+* syscall: regenerate zerrors for darwin/linux/freebsd,\n+\tsupport for tty options in StartProcess (thanks Ken Rockot).\n+* testing: make ResetTimer not start/stop the timer,\n+\tscale benchmark precision to 0.01ns if needed.\n+* time: zero-pad two-digit years.\n+* unicode/maketables: update debugging data.\n+* windows: define and use syscall.Handle (thanks Wei Guangjing).\n+* xml: add Marshal and MarshalIndent.\n+</pre>\n+\n <h2 id=\"2011-06-23\">2011-06-23</h2>\n \n <pre>"}]}
